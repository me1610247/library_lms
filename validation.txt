 validations refer to the process of validating incoming data
, typically from user input, to ensure it meets certain criteria
 or rules before using it in the application. Laravel provides a convenient
 and expressive way to handle data validation through its built-in validation features.
like
$validatedData = $request->validate([
    'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
    'email' => 'required|email|unique:users|max:255',
    'password' => 'required|string|min:8|confirmed',
]);
