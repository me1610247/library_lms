he Service Container is a powerful tool responsible for
 managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection
like
interface PaymentGateway {
    public function process();
}

class CreditCardPaymentGateway implements PaymentGateway {
    public function process() {
        // Process credit card payment
    }
}

class PaymentProcessor {
    protected $gateway;

    public function __construct(PaymentGateway $gateway) {
        $this->gateway = $gateway;
    }

    public function purchase() {
        $this->gateway->process();
    }
}
Here, the PaymentProcessor class depends on a PaymentGateway interface. Laravel's Service Container can automatically resolve the dependency by binding the interface to its concrete implementation.

The Service Container allows you to bind this implementation to the interface like so:
