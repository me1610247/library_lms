 the response refers to the result sent back to the client (usually a web browser) 
as a result of a request made to a Laravel application.
 It encompasses the content that the server generates and returns to the user's browser, 
which could include HTML, JSON, files, or redirections
like
HTML Response: This is the most common type of response in web applications. When a user visits a web page
public function index()
{
    return view('welcome');
}
JSON Response
public function getUserData()
{
    $userData = User::all();
    return response()->json($userData);
}
File Downloads:
public function downloadFile()
{
    return response()->download('path/to/file.pdf');
}
